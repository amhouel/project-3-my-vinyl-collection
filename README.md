# Full stack app boilerplate

This is boilerplate for a full-stack app.

## Install JS dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Modify the database name

The database name is defined in `createDb.sql` and `models.js`. You'll need to edit them by hand for now.

## Create the database

```
npm run db
```

This will drop the database, recreate it, create tables defined in `models.js`, and seed the database with instance data from `seed.js`

## Run the development server

This will start both the Express API server and the React application.

```
npm run dev
```
